notes: |
  Unreal Engine is used by many AAA and indie developers.
  Epic Games provides official modding support for some titles (Fortnite Creative, etc.).
  
  Publisher-specific considerations:
  - Epic's own games: Generally modding-friendly
  - Third-party AAA: Usually restrictive (check individual policies)
  - Indie games: Often more permissive
  
  Technical notes:
  - UE4 uses .pak files with optional encryption
  - UE5 introduced IoStore system (.utoc/.ucas files)
  - Encryption keys may be required for protected content
  - .uasset files contain serialized object data
  
  Format evolution:
  - UE4: PAK-based system, relatively stable
  - UE5: IoStore system, improved compression and loading
  - Version-specific serialization formats
  
  Always verify publisher-specific policies before extraction.
