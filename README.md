# Aegis-Assets
Professional-grade infrastructure for game asset extraction, preservation, and creative workflows

🛡️ Aegis-Assets

Compliance-first platform for game asset extraction, preservation, and creative workflows.

Aegis-Assets is not just another extractor. It’s the first professional-grade, compliance-aware system built for:

🎨 Modders & creators → unlock game assets for personal projects & content workflows.

🏛️ Archivists & researchers → preserve digital culture safely and sustainably.

🏢 Studios & institutions → integrate asset pipelines with risk management built in.

🚀 Mission

To unify fragmented extraction tools into sustainable infrastructure for the next generation of game-adjacent creative industries.
Where others chase raw breadth, Aegis competes on trust, compliance, and sustainability.

⚖️ The Compliance Manifesto

Aegis-Assets is built on a compliance-first architecture.
That means we do not support every format at any cost. Instead, we:

Respect Legal Boundaries

If a publisher has a history of aggressive IP enforcement (e.g. Nintendo), we do not provide official support.

These formats are excluded from bounties, documentation, and tutorials.

Enable but Don’t Endorse

The plugin system allows community submissions.

High-risk formats are clearly sandboxed with disclaimers.

Enterprises can mark formats as “high-risk” via compliance profiles.

Build for the Long Game

Compliance profiles make risks visible.

Audit trails ensure institutional defensibility.

Responsible choices today protect the community tomorrow.

🛠️ Features

⚡ Rust Core Engine → high-performance, memory-safe, parallel extraction.

🔌 Plugin Architecture → extendable format support without burning out maintainers.

🗂️ Patch Recipe System → exports deltas, not copyrighted content.

📜 Compliance Profiles → per-game legal risk indicators.

📝 Audit Trails → enterprise-ready provenance logs.

🤖 AI-Powered Tools (Pro) → auto-tagging, PBR derivation, semantic search.

🖼️ GUI & Web Preview → glTF2 + KTX2 + OGG viewing without engines installed.

🔒 Why Compliance Matters

Every other tool competes on format breadth.
Aegis competes on trust:

For enterprises: built-in risk management.

For communities: sustainable, future-proof development.

For investors/partners: defensible moat through compliance leadership.

This stance is not a weakness — it’s our category-defining advantage.
