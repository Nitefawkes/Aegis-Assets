# 🛡️ Aegis-Assets

**Compliance-first platform for game asset extraction, preservation, and creative workflows.**

Aegis-Assets is not *just another extractor*. It's the first professional-grade, compliance-aware system built for:

* 🎨 **Modders & creators** → unlock game assets for personal projects & content workflows.
* 🏛️ **Archivists & researchers** → preserve digital culture safely and sustainably.
* 🏢 **Studios & institutions** → integrate asset pipelines with risk management built in.

## 🚀 Mission

**To unify fragmented extraction tools into sustainable infrastructure for the next generation of game-adjacent creative industries.** Where others chase raw breadth, Aegis competes on **trust, compliance, and sustainability**.

## ⚖️ The Compliance Manifesto

Aegis-Assets is built on a **compliance-first architecture**. That means we **do not support every format at any cost**. Instead, we:

### 1. **Respect Legal Boundaries**
* If a publisher has a history of aggressive IP enforcement (e.g. Nintendo), we **do not provide official support**.
* These formats are excluded from bounties, documentation, and tutorials.

### 2. **Enable but Don't Endorse**
* The plugin system allows community submissions.
* High-risk formats are clearly **sandboxed with disclaimers**.
* Enterprises can mark formats as "high-risk" via compliance profiles.

### 3. **Build for the Long Game**
* Compliance profiles make risks visible.
* Audit trails ensure institutional defensibility.
* Responsible choices today protect the community tomorrow.

This stance is not a weakness — it's our **category-defining advantage**.
