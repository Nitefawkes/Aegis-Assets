notes: |
  Unity is a game engine used by thousands of developers worldwide.
  Each game has its own publisher and IP policies.
  
  Common considerations for Unity games:
  - Indie games: Often more permissive, but check individual policies
  - Mobile games: Frequently have restrictive terms
  - AAA games: Usually have strict IP enforcement
  
  Technical notes:
  - Unity formats change frequently across engine versions
  - Asset encryption is possible but not standard
  - Most Unity games store assets in easily accessible formats
  
  Always verify the specific game's publisher policy before extraction.
  This profile serves as a fallback for unknown Unity titles.
