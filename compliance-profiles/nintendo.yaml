notes: |
  Nintendo does not provide official modding support for most games.
  The company has consistently opposed fan projects using their assets.
  Legal precedent suggests high risk for any commercial or public use.
  
  Alternatives:
  - Check for officially licensed development tools
  - Consider clean-room implementations for research
  - Focus on gameplay mechanics rather than assets
