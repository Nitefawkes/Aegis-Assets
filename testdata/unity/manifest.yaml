# Usage notes
notes: |
  This corpus should be sourced from:
  1. Public domain Unity games (itch.io CC0 releases)
  2. Unity tutorial/sample projects (with proper attribution)
  3. Anonymized community contributions (permission granted)
  
  Each sample should be documented with:
  - Source attribution
  - License information  
  - Expected asset counts by type
  - Compression algorithm used
  
  Samples will be used for:
  - Performance regression testing in CI
  - Memory usage validation
  - Format conversion accuracy testing
  - Streaming extraction validation
