notes: |
  Valve has historically been very supportive of modding communities.
  Source SDK and Source 2 tools are provided for developers.
  Many successful games started as Valve mods (Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, etc.).
  
  Official policy allows:
  - Creating mods and total conversions
  - Educational and research use
  - Asset extraction for compatible mods
  
  Restrictions:
  - Commercial redistribution requires licensing
  - Cannot distribute complete game assets outside mod context
  - Respect game-specific EULAs (some may have additional restrictions)
